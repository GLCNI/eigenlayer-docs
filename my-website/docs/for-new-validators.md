# Create a new validator for Native restaking

## For New Validators

If setting up a new validator for native restaking, withdrawal credentials can be set to point directly to your EigenPod at the time of validator keystore creation.

The Process is as follows: 
1. [Create Validator Keys](create-validator-keys.md)
2. [Run Ethereum Node](run-ethereum-node.md)
3. [Import Keystores](import-validator-keystores.md)
4. [Make Deposit](make-deposit.md)

:memo: New validators should carefully read the [Ethereum Launchpad FAQ](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/) and review checklists before validator setup.
