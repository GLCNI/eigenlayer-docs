# Native Restaking
## How to restake and withdraw with Native Staking

Native restaking describes the process of operating a validator node to secure Ethereum consensus and extending this cryptoeconomic security to other applications though Eigenlayer, by pointing withdrawal credentials to EigenLayer's smart contracts.

There are two options for Native restaking:

1. [**Repoint validator credentials:**](./for-existing-validators.md) for existing validators to restake with EigenLayer.

2. [**Create a new validator for Native restaking:**](./for-new-validators.md) setup of a new validator for restaking with EigenLayer.


:warning:  Please read this entire guide before launching your new validator or integrating your existing validator.

:memo:  To learn more or setup your Ethereum Validator please follow this link from the [Ethereum Foundation.](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/)
